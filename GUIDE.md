## Configuration Options

The system supports several configuration options through environment variables:

1. **OPENAI_API_KEY**: Your OpenAI API key for Whisper and GPT-4o access

2. **TRANSCRIPTION_HISTORY_SIZE**: Number of segments to store in history (default: 2000)

3. **LLM_MODEL**: The LLM model to use for overlap resolution (default: gpt-4o)

## Transcription Process in Detail

The transcription process follows these steps:

1. **Audio Extraction**:
   - The system connects to the YouTube livestream URL
   - FFmpeg extracts audio in 15-second chunks with 3-second overlaps
   - Audio is enhanced and converted to multiple formats

2. **Queuing**:
   - Audio chunks are added to priority queues
   - Multiple formats of the same chunk are processed in sequence
   - The system prioritizes processing of newer chunks

3. **Transcription**:
   - Each chunk is transcribed using OpenAI's Whisper API
   - Each new transcription is analyzed in context with the previous transcription
   - LLM-based overlap resolution identifies and extracts only the new content

4. **LLM Overlap Analysis**:
   - The system provides both transcriptions (previous and current) to GPT-4o
   - The LLM identifies exactly where new content begins in the overlapping segment
   - The system merges only the unique content with proper context

5. **Output Delivery**:
   - Transcription results are sent to the client in real-time
   - The frontend displays these results as they arrive
   - Merged segments are marked to indicate processing

The key to the system's effectiveness is the LLM-powered overlap processing:

```
Audio Stream: |-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
Chunks:       |--------------|
                    |--------------|
                           |--------------|
                                  |--------------|
```

Each 15-second chunk overlaps with the previous and next chunks by 3 seconds.
The LLM analyzes these overlapping sections to ensure no content is missed or duplicated.

## Performance Considerations

- The system is designed for real-time processing but has resource limitations:
  - Each active stream requires approximately 50-100MB of memory
  - CPU usage increases with concurrent transcriptions
  - Network bandwidth depends on stream quality and concurrent users
