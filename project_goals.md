# YouTube Livestream Transcriber - Project Goals

## Project Overview

We're building a real-time YouTube livestream transcription application that connects to YouTube livestreams, extracts the audio, and provides accurate transcription using OpenAI's Whisper API. The application will also automatically detect topic changes in the conversation and organize content accordingly.

## Current Progress (Updated)

- ‚úÖ **YouTube Livestream Connection**: Successfully implemented connection to YouTube livestreams using yt-dlp and FFmpeg for audio extraction
- ‚úÖ **Audio Processing Pipeline**: Implemented segmentation and conversion of audio chunks with optimized overlapping
- ‚úÖ **Real-time Transcription**: Integrated OpenAI's Whisper API for audio transcription
- ‚úÖ **Socket.IO Communication**: Set up real-time updates between server and client
- ‚úÖ **Deduplication System**: Added intelligent filtering to prevent repeated transcriptions
- ‚úÖ **Chunk Overlap Optimization**: Implemented 15-second chunks with 10-second overlaps (5-second advancement)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Transcription Accuracy**: Significantly improved through frequent chunk processing, but still refining
- ‚è≥ **Topic Change Detection**: Not yet implemented
- ‚è≥ **Advanced UI Features**: Basic UI implemented, advanced features pending

## Current Sprint Goals

- ‚úÖ **Real-time Transcription**: Integrated OpenAI's Whisper API for audio transcription
- ‚úÖ **YouTube Integration**: Connected to YouTube livestreams for audio extraction
- ‚úÖ **UI Development**: Created responsive interface for displaying transcriptions
- ‚úÖ **Overlap Optimization**: Implemented LLM-based overlap resolution to prevent content loss
- ‚úÖ **Chunk Processing Optimization**: Implemented 5-second advancement between 15-second chunks
- ‚¨ú **Topic Detection**: Detect topic changes in the conversation
- ‚¨ú **Content Organization**: Group transcribed content by topics

   - ‚è≥ Enhance merging of transcription segments

4. **Topic Change Detection**
   - ‚è≥ Automatically identify conversation topic changes
   - ‚è≥ Use dual-LLM verification for accuracy (mark verified topics with ü§ñü§ñ)
   - ‚è≥ Generate descriptive topic titles
   - ‚è≥ Display topics with timestamps and detection reasons

5. **User Interface**
   - ‚úÖ Create basic interface with transcription display
   - ‚è≥ Implement dark mode support
   - ‚è≥ Add interactive topic history with detection information
