## Known Issues

- Some transcription accuracy issues remain with occasional missed words or sentence endings
- FFmpeg extraction sometimes fails to capture audio cleanly

## Performance Considerations

- The application is currently optimized for development and testing
- Further optimization will be needed for production deployment
- Memory usage should be monitored when implementing the transcription system
- Debug logging should be configurable for production environments to minimize performance impact
- Audio processing resource usage should be monitored for long-running livestreams
- Deduplication system adds minimal overhead but should be monitored
- Increased chunk processing frequency (every 5 seconds) increases CPU usage but improves transcription quality

## Future Enhancements

- Add user authentication for personalized experiences
- Implement transcript export functionality (TXT, SRT, etc.)
- Add support for additional video platforms beyond YouTube
- Develop a more sophisticated UI with visualization of topic changes
- Enhance debug console with search functionality and log export options

## Latest Updates

- Implemented LLM-based overlap resolution using GPT-3.5-Turbo to intelligently analyze and extract unique content from overlapping transcription segments
- Optimized audio chunking parameters for better transcription continuity:
  - Maintained 15-second chunk size for consistent display
  - Increased overlap from 3 seconds to 10 seconds
  - Reduced advancement between chunks from 12 seconds to 5 seconds
  - This creates a 66% overlap between consecutive chunks, significantly reducing narrative gaps
- Reduced waiting time between chunk processing from 15 seconds to 5 seconds
- Improved transcription accuracy by processing chunks more frequently with greater overlap
- Fixed timestamp display to show exact timestamps rather than rounding to 15-second boundaries
